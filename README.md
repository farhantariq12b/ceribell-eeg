## Setup

- Install node 18(18.16.0)

- To install all the dependencies run this command`npm install`

- Start the server with this command `npm start`

- the project should be up by now and ready to serve on [Open Project](http://localhost:3000)

## Note

There is a lot of data in Graphs so, It will take some time to render on localhost.

- Please add this extension to your browser. The reason is that the server where we are making API calls gives a CORS error on localhost because localhost is not added on the server side as an allowed origin.
